# Wrangle-and-analyze-data

The dataset that I worked on is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as 
WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment 
about the dog
I imported the various tables needed for the project twitter_archived,image_predictions and tweet_json
respectively.
After wrangling the data,and did my analysis, I got some insights from the wrangled data.
